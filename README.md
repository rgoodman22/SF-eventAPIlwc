# Salesforce event API LWC

Code from the Emp API component documentation: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-emp-api/documentation

## Modifications (John Scardino)

Planned modification to handle messages in UI versus in console.

## Modifications (Robert Goodman)

Planned modification to handle messages in the lwc as opposed to toast on the platform.  Seeking to have live update on each event; automatic population of the component.
